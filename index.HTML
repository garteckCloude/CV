<p>I live in a semi-urban area of Lagos, Nigeria,And as a kid who grew up curious, and fascinated by technology, I always wanted to understand
how technology came about and why? This curiosity led me to the<a href="https://www.woc.co.uk/"> <em><b>world of computers.</b></em></a>
Interestingly, It happened that my eldest sister was very much interested in computers and was
studying <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science#:~:text=Computer%20science%20is%20the%20study,hardware%20development%2C%20and%20artificial%20intelligence"> <em><b> computer science </b></em></a> at the University at the time of my discovery. Once she found out I
had similar interests, she decided to mentor me on the journey. I was introduced to coding by
her three years ago, and I started with the basics of HTML and CSS. This simple act has been
guarding my decisions and the courses I took in upper secondary classes.<hr />
